## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure all your app’s services (like a web server, database, cache, etc.) using a single YAML file, and run them with a single command.

## Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is Docker’s native orchestration tool that allows you to deploy, manage, and scale a cluster of Docker containers across multiple machines (called nodes) as if they were a single system.

Think of it as a way to coordinate a group of Docker hosts to work together and run containerized applications in a distributed, highly available way.
